# Multi-Task Learning Sparse Group Lasso Model
The project developed a Multi-Task Learning Sparse Group Lasso (MTL-SGL) model that uses multisourced serologic data (e.g. HI assay) to learn antigenicity-associated mutations and glycosylation sites. This model is also able to infer antigenic variant by quantifying antigenic distance. By applying MTL-SGL to influenza H1 hemagglutinin sequences, we showed the method enables rapid characterization of antigenic profiles and identification of antigenic variants on a large scale.
